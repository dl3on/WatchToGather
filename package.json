  "description": "This is a browser extension that enables friends to sync their videos together when watching any video on a website, using peer-to-peer (P2P). The host has to create a room providing the initial URL to the video website and share it to their friends. Everyone in the room can pause, play, seek, or go to the next episode/video: it's like controlling the TV in a room with your friends. This extension works for any video website.",
